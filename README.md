A Python project with mysql connectivity for Hospital management system

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed for Any Hospital to
replace their existing manual, paper-based system. This System targets to
provide complete solution for Hospital and Health care services. This
System can be used in any Hospital, Clinic, Diagnostics or Pathology labs
for maintaining patient details and their test results. It integrates the entire
resources of a hospital into one integrated software.
This project comes with an interface where the user has to login using their
username and password. If login credentials are correct, the user is
directed to another window where the user can choose from different
dropdowns such as

New registration of a 1. Doctor
2. Patient
3. Worker

To display total details of 1. Doctors
2. Patients
3. Workers

Individual details of 1. Doctors
2. Patients
3. Workers

Hospital management is a user-friendly system that has significant features
needed for the ideal management of a hospital. Our project comes with the
essential features such as registration of a new patient, new doctors,
viewing total details of Patients, doctors or other staffs. This project can be
further expanded by adding features for pharmacy details, online
appointment facilities, and billing details along with an improved security
system.
